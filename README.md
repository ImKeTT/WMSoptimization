## Warehouse Management System based on Ant Colony Optimization algorithm

An novel idea to solve the famous np-hard problem *'the Optimal Hamiltonian pathway'*.

Firstly, we solve the corresponding relaxed problem of finding the optimal Hamiltonian circle (TSP problem). Then, we do the *'ring splitting'* to search for the final point in different conditions. And we regard this answer to be the approximate best solution to the original one.
