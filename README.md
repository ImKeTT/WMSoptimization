## Warehouse Management System based on Ant Colony Optimization algorithm

our solution to [Problem-C of 2020 Mathorcup competition](https://www.saikr.com/c/nd/6456)

A novel idea to solve the famous np-hard problem *'the Shortest Hamiltonian pathway'*.

Firstly, we solve the corresponding relaxed problem of finding the optimal Hamiltonian circle (TSP problem). Then, we do the *'ring splitting'* action to search for the final point in different conditions. And we regard this answer to be the approximate best solution to the original one. 

**To be improved..**
